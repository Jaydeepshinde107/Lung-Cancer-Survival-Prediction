# Lung-Cancer-Survival-Prediction
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to predict survival outcomes in patients diagnosed with lung cancer. The objective is to build robust predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients, optimizing treatment plans, and improving overall patient care. The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that integrates demographic, clinical,and lifestyle factors contributing to lung cancer prognosis.
